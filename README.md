# PhylogeneticTrees.jl

PhylogeneticTrees is a package implementing miqoGraph, a fast algorithm to fit admixture trees using mixed-integer quadratic optimization.  It was developed using the [Julia]("http://julialang.org/") language and the [Gurobi]("http://www.gurobi.com/") optimization solver.

## Installation

PhylogeneticTrees is implemented using the Gurobi optimization solver, which has a [free academic license]("http://www.gurobi.com/registration/academic-license-reg").  The instructions for installation can be found [here]("http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/").

The Julia language can be downloaded [here]("https://julialang.org/downloads/").

PhylogeneticTrees can be installed through the Julia package manager:

```
(v1.0) pkg> add "https://github.com/juliayyan/PhylogeneticTrees.jl" 
```

To check that the installation is working properly, run the following within the package manager:

```
(v1.0) pkg> test PhylogeneticTrees
```
